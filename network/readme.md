# networkMoni

Due to the interrupting and dissapointing network condition at home I wrote this,which can see the current network sent and recv status,if seeing from cmd,

# Require

`pysutil`

# Problem remain

# Noted

If it don't show normal on your cmd command line, try to change your cmd codepage to utf-8(**Enter** `chcp 65001`)
