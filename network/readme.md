# networkMoni

Due to the interrupting and dissapointing network condition at home I wrote this,which can see the current network sent and recv status,if seeing from cmd,
the color of the font can change randomly

## Require

- `psutil`
- `click`

## Usage

Directly run `python networkMoni.py` or `python networkMoni.py --help`


## Problem remain

Infos are too little,and the outputs too ugly.Save for latter change.

## Noted

If it don't show normal on your cmd command line, try to change your cmd codepage to utf-8(**Enter** `chcp 65001`)
